# Resouce-Sharing-on-Adhoc-Network

This project was a part of undergraduate engineering course IS F462 Network Programming Dated Aug 2017.

We propose a platform which allows individuals to share the resources of their devices among themselves and to effectively utilize their computing power.

The project aims to provide local resource sharing platform by connecting to an Ad Hoc network. Users can transfer multiple files to the system hosting the required service and then work on those transferred files using that service. Multiple users can connect and use the resources at the same time on any of the connected system. The platform is developed using Java to facilitate easy integration of the platform on systems running on any OS supporting Java JDK.
